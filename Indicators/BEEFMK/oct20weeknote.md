### Oct 16 Week 3
##### → Rethinking beef market (BEEFMK) indicator
Policy: Methane Emissions (note: this indicator is really focused on “beef policy”, which is a proxy for methane emissions) 
→ Taking a step back: what is “beef policy” as it relates to methane emissions?
Policies to regulate demand +  supply;
Data backed evidence that Beef is a major source of climate change:
Cow methane emissions
Local vs Global effect: how does beef price vary locally/globally? 
Global price data at country level 
Corroborate it’s de facto the Policy impact

For example, the EAT-Lancet Commission recommends limiting red meat consumption to below 98 grams per week for overall environmental sustainability and health reasons.
Other guidelines are focused on specific issues, with guidelines by the World Cancer Research Forum (WCRF) directed at reducing bowel cancer prevalence. 
In this case, the WCRF recommends that individuals should eat very little, if any processed meat and no more than 500g (cooked weight) of red meat per week. 
These guidelines are similar to those issues by the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK.

We care about the beef market because 1. Global warming; 2. Personal well-being [diabetes, cancer]; 3. Viral infections (Health of the planet + health of the people)

India cultural force vs policy impacts
What specific policies are they implementing, can they serve as a model for other countries? Are they making sufficient progress?
