### Indian Beef Market:
India has become one of the top exporters of beef after Brazil. 
Contrary to the perception of India in the western imagination as a predominantly vegetarian country, according to recent National Sample Survey data, more than 70% of Indians above the age of 15 are non-vegetarian. And while chicken is the most widely consumed meat, even classic beef items like burgers and steaks had become popular on menus in top restaurants across Indian cities in the last decade.
In 2005, 2015. the Indian government bans the Slaughter, Sale, And Consumption of cows around 18 states. The bill also includes a ban on the slaughter of bulls and bullocks, but not water buffaloes.
One tweet points out that someone can get a two-year prison term for drunken driving or manslaughter, but five years for eating beef.
In India, cows are considered sacred in the Hindu religion, but the beef industry is typically run by Muslims. 

### Motivations:
Climate change: India is suffering from some repercussions;
Water shortage: agriculture consists of 70% of the water usage;
Health: reduce the possibility of getting sick;
Cultural and local factors:
Almost 30% of Indians are vegetarian, and most Indians have never even tasted beef. 
Cows matter to many Indians: rely on cows for milk, instrumental in farming, pets;

### Concern over the policy implementation:
Reduced beef supply for the world; don’t see much impact on beef?
Social and religious equilibrium of a diverse and complex society;
Loss of jobs; 

### Summary:
Beef ban can bring environmental and social benefits but also creates new problems. The policy ban should consider the interests of people, and maybe should proceed step by step rather than ban for all to prevent social unrest and sudden drop in supply and job sources. The process is difficult for a country that has many vegetarians, not to mention countries that consume beef as part of their daily life. The ban has created contentions between different groups of people. In countries like the US that eats a lot of beef per day, it would be difficult to impose a beef ban since it is one of the protein sources for many families; Especially poor people who consume fast food. Healthy vegetables that can substitute the food can be expensive;

The Indian policy can serve as a helpful experimental trial and as a guideline for countries to think about how to deal with the consequences after the ban, and if a strict ban would be needed. If punishment is needed, how much is reasonable. To what extent would people think that this is not an intrusion into their own consumption choice and it’s an important mission that we all agree to engage in? Some countries are deeply connected with other countries. If a beef exporter like India stops exporting meat for their own good, then it could potentially impact the rest of the countries since they rely on India for beef. It is impossible to have all countries ban consumption of meat all at once and there are many more other factors to take into consideration.
