## Repository Guidelines
- Analysis should be grouped by Indicator, Category, or by some other unit of analysis.
- Name your files and directories for posterity: it should be clear what your code is doing
- Code must be reproducible: it needs to run on my computer as well as yours. See me for help setting up the virtual environment
- Any data for your analysis needs to be contained in the same folder as your code
- Add ReadMe files for explanation of anything that is not self-explanatory
- Merge to main via pull request when you're ready for me to review your work
